Implementing a parallelized kmeans algorithm with Cuda

## Steps
Here are the tasks we need to go through

| Step | Task | Status |
|-------------|
| 1 | Write a program to generate data given the number of clusters, number of points and number of dimensions | |
| 2 | Write the non-parallel 2D kmeans algorithm and verify it against OpenCV's code | |
| 3 | Extend code to n dimensions | |
| 4 | (practice) Get Cuda working | |
| 5 | (practice) Calculate the squares of an array of number using Cuda | |
| 6 | (practice) Do gaussian blurring with Cuda + OpenCV | |
| 7 | Figure out how to parallelize k-means with Cuda | |
| 8 | Write parallel code for k-means with cuda / verify against non-parallel algorithm | |
| 9 | Code cleanup and code review | |
